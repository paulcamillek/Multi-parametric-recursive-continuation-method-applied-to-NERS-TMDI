function [x,p]=branch_follow2(fname,nsteps,mu0,mu1,x0,x1,sysP)
% The aim of this program is to follow solution branches to systems of nonlinear
% equations with one free parameter. 

% You start with a file fname. This file uses a global parameter (called mu).
% Once mu is defined, given x, this file returns f(x). Note: x is n-dimensional.
% In the space of x, there  is a one-parameter family (or curve) of solutions
% parameterized by mu. Two nearby points on this curve (mu0,x0) and (mu1,x1) are 
% initially specified (found manually with trial and error). Our aim is to generate
% a sequence of points (mu2,x2), (mu3,x3) etc. The distance between each point
% and the next one is to be kept fixed as we move along the curve. Some auxiliary
% files will be needed, and called as appropriate.

global mu tracking_file_name xc arc

% We specify the file name containing the function whose roots are to be
% tracked. This would be used for augmenting the system equations with the 
% arclength constraint in the file branch_aux.
tracking_file_name=fname;

% In the next portion, we extend the solution vector x by 1 by adding
% the varibale mu to it. This will be useful in fixing the arclength of the
% curve to be tracked.
%keyboard
x0=[x0;mu0]; % The first point on the curve.
xc=[x1;mu1]; % The second point on the curve.

% Below we initialize the solution vector x which will be storing the
% extended solutions for the problem.
x=[x0,xc];

% The arclength is fixed based on the first two initial conditions that are
% specifed as inputs to this file.
arc=norm(x0-xc);

% k is the counter number for continuation and c is the handle which
% specifies if the newton method used for getting the roots of the
% equations has converged or not. If the method does not converge, we will
% have c=0. We initialize it to be c=1.
